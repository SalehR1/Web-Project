# Univets "FS Web Dev Final Project"

Our project is a digital platform designed to centralize and streamline event 
communication at Taibahu University. Currently, the university lacks an efficient way to 
inform students about upcoming events, leading to low awareness and participation. 
Many events go unnoticed simply because there is no dedicated space for students to 
check whatâ€™s happening on campus. 
 
Our platform will serve as the go-to hub for all university events, providing students 
with real-time updates on upcoming activities. Additionally, it will enable the university 
to engage students more effectively. For instance, if an event requires a student host or 
volunteer, the university can post announcements or open applications directly through 
our platform. 
 
The project aims to bridge the gap between students and university events, fostering a 
more connected and engaged campus community.
